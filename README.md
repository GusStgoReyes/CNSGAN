# CNS-GAN

Implementation of an fMRI-to-Image model leveraging the content of images from the NSD dataset. The data from this google drive must be downloaded first: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=176Vygj8SMic_p9tZtgqw60GtSA50D_VG

Furthermore, the repository of DCNN-GAN was forked and modified in this github: https://github.com/GusStgoReyes/CNS-GAN.git. 

The baseline.ipynb contains the necessary procedure to run the baseline model (DCNN-GAN). The newCNS-GAN.ipynb contains the new model developed and the procedure to train/test the model.
